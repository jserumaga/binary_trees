This is a README file for the 0x1D. C - Binary trees project.
This project has the follow tasks;
1. Write a function that creates a binary tree node
2. Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
3. Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node
4. Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree
5. Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf
6. Write a function that checks if a given node is a root
7. Write a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
8. Write a function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
9. Write a function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal
10. Write a function that measures the height of a binary tree
